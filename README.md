### This repo contains an implementation of Pokemon game!!
### The game is being played on a directed weighted graph in Python!
---
### How to play the game?
The pokemons are located on the graph’s (directed) edges, therefore, the agent needs to take the proper edge to “grab” the pokemon while each pokemon contains a value of points.
The goal is to maximize the overall sum of points of the “grabbed” pokemons at a given limited time.


### What does the game contains? <br>
- Given graph
- Amount of agents
- Amaunt of pokemons that appears on the graph edges at every given moment

## Here you can see an example of how the game works:
