## This repo contains an implementation of Pokemon game played on a directed weighted graph in Python!
### How does our game been played?
The pokemons are located on the graph’s (directed) edges, therefore, the agent needs to take the proper edge to “grab” the pokemon while each pokemon contains a value of points.
The goal is to maximize the overall sum of points of the “grabbed” pokemons at a given limited time.


### What does the game contains? <br>
- Given graph
- Amount of agents
- Amaunt of pokemons that appears on the graph edges at every given moment
